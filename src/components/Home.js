        <p>
          We have a variety of cats looking for homes, some require
          access to the outdoors, some are indoor only.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our cats and kittens are health-checked by our vets they have
          at least their 1st vaccination along with microchip, and up to date
          with flea and worm treatments.
